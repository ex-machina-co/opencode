OpenCode Go is a low cost **$10/month** subscription that gives you reliable access to popular open coding models.

:::note
OpenCode Go is currently in beta.
:::

Go works like any other provider in OpenCode. You subscribe to OpenCode Go and
get your API key. It's **completely optional** and you don't need to use it to
use OpenCode.

It is designed primarily for international users, with models hosted in the US, EU, and Singapore for stable global access.

## Background

Open models have gotten really good. They now reach performance close to
proprietary models for coding tasks. And because many providers can serve them
competitively, they are usually far cheaper.

However, getting reliable, low latency access to them can be difficult. Providers
vary in quality and availability.

:::tip
We tested a select group of models and providers that work well with OpenCode.
:::

To fix this, we did a couple of things:

1. We tested a select group of open models and talked to their teams about how to
   best run them.
2. We then worked with a few providers to make sure these were being served
   correctly.
3. Finally, we benchmarked the combination of the model/provider and came up
   with a list that we feel good recommending.

OpenCode Go gives you access to these models for **$10/month**.

## How it works

OpenCode Go works like any other provider in OpenCode.

1. You sign in to **<a href={console}>OpenCode Zen</a>**, subscribe to Go, and
   copy your API key.
2. You run the `/connect` command in the TUI, select `OpenCode Go`, and paste
   your API key.
3. Run `/models` in the TUI to see the list of models available through Go.

:::note
Only one member per workspace can subscribe to OpenCode Go.
:::

The current list of models includes:

- **Kimi K2.5**
- **GLM-5**
- **MiniMax M2.5**

The list of models may change as we test and add new ones.

## Usage limits

OpenCode Go includes the following limits:

- **5 hour limit** — $4 of usage
- **Weekly limit** — $10 of usage
- **Monthly limit** — $20 of usage

In terms of tokens, $20 of usage is roughly equivalent to:

- 69 million GLM-5 tokens
- 121 million Kimi K2.5 tokens
- 328 million MiniMax M2.5 tokens

You can view your current usage in the **<a href={console}>console</a>**.

:::tip
If you reach the usage limit, you can continue using the free models.
:::

Usage limits may change as we learn from early usage and feedback.

### Pricing

OpenCode Go is a **$10/month** subscription plan. Below are the prices **per 1M tokens**.

| Model        | Input | Output | Cached Read |
| ------------ | ----- | ------ | ----------- |
| GLM-5        | $1.00 | $3.20  | $0.20       |
| Kimi K2.5    | $0.60 | $3.00  | $0.10       |
| MiniMax M2.5 | $0.30 | $1.20  | $0.03       |

---

### Usage beyond limits

If you also have credits on your Zen balance, you can enable the **Use balance**
option in the console. When enabled, Go will fall back to your Zen balance
after you've reached your usage limits instead of blocking requests.

---

## Endpoints

You can also access Go models through the following API endpoints.

| Model        | Model ID     | Endpoint                                         | AI SDK Package              |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| GLM-5        | glm-5        | `https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/chat/completions` | `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` |
| Kimi K2.5    | kimi-k2.5    | `https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/chat/completions` | `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` |
| MiniMax M2.5 | minimax-m2.5 | `https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/messages`         | `@ai-sdk/anthropic`         |

The [model id](/docs/config/#models) in your OpenCode config
uses the format `opencode-go/<model-id>`. For example, for Kimi K2.5, you would
use `opencode-go/kimi-k2.5` in your config.

## Goals

We created OpenCode Go to:

1. Make AI coding **accessible** to more people with a low cost subscription.
2. Provide **reliable** access to the best open coding models.
3. Curate models that are **tested and benchmarked** for coding agent use.
4. Have **no lock-in** by allowing you to use any other provider with OpenCode as well.
